# Spotify Lyrics :notes:

Automatically display the current Spotify song's lyrics to a Discord channel and terminal.

## About :musical_note:	
This Python program will use the spotipy library to get the title track and artist of the currently playing song. Next lyricsgenius will use that information to search the title track and artist and use a Discord webhook to display the lyrics.

## Demo :desktop_computer:

## Installation ðŸ› 
```bash
pip3 install lyricsgenius
```
```bash
pip3 install spotipy
```
```bash
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

```bash
pip3 install discord_webhook
```
## Notes :bulb:
- Discord: Server Settings > Integration > Webhooks > New Webhook > Copy Webhook URL > paste into .env file.
- The lyrics need to be available in Genius's music lyric database in order to be displayed.
- If the title track and artist yield no results, the program will try to search again without the artist to account for possible song covers and look for the original artist.

##
Displaying the lyrics to both the Discord channel and terminal:
```bash
python3 run bot.py
```
Displaying lyrics to the terminal only:
```bash
python3 spotify_lyrics.py
```
